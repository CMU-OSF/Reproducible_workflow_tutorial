# What's Git?

- Think: revision history/track changes/undo for entire folders

--

- aka: "version control system"

--

- Stream of snapshots, can be played back (the story of your project)

--

- Keeping record of what has changed (when &amp; who)

--

- Useful for the lone coder, excellent for collaboration

# Plain text is king

- Developed for software development: code

--

- But also: data, analysis code, reports, manuscripts 

--

- Works on anything that is plain text (.csv,.py,.html,.md,...)

--

- Tools do not work on docx, image, pdf files ([pandoc](https://www.pandoc.org))

# Installing Git

- [Download here](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (Mac &amp; Win)


- Open a command line (Rstudio -&gt; Git -&gt; More -&gt; shell)
- Set up your git email by typing *git config --global user.email YOUR_EMAIL*
- Set up your git name by typing *git config --global user.name YOUR_NAME*
- Create a [Github account](https://github.com/join). Use the same email you used to configure git.

# Git cracking

Several ways to use git: 

- [Command line](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)

- GUI (e.g. [gitkraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/), [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0y_xCeM1Rk))

- On [Github](https://www.github.com)

--

- **inside Rstudio** (Most accessible)

---

# Initialize your project


.pull-left[

- Rstudio -&gt; New project -&gt; from new directory -&gt; tick: "create git repository"

*or*: 

- Github -&gt; Repositories -&gt; New 
    * then in Rstudio: New project -&gt; from version control-&gt; repository url (**Recommended**)
    
(*or*: In project folder: Command: **git init**)
]
.pull-right[![Right-aligned image](img/7_new_project.jpg)]

---
# Your new repository ("repo")

Automatically creates:

- *.git*-folder where your version history lives

--

- *.gitignore*-file lists filetypes that should be ignored (eg backup files created by our editor or intermediate files created during data analysis) 

--

- Optional: a *README* file (through github)

--

- Optional: a *LICENSE* file (through github)

---

# Your git workflow

First you code, gather data, write, analyze, plot,...

Then you add files (**"staging"**): *determines what will go into the snapshot.*

- Rstudio: git tab -&gt; Check boxes
- *git add myfile.txt*

---

# Commitment needed


- Rstudio: git tab `\(\to\)` Commit
- *git commit -m "my commit message"*

![image](img/git-committing.png)


---

# Commitment needed

- Commit messages:

Not required, but strongly recommended. Be informative (like code comments, [focus on the why](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/))

--

- Why two steps? (Not: *git commit -a*)

Git insists we add files explicitly before committing to allow us to commit our changes in stages and capture changes in logical portions rather than only large batches.

background-size: 300px
background-position: 50% 80%

# When to commit?

- At least daily (if you have worked on the project)

- But better: more frequently (logical chunks): 
    - I finished building this functionality or fixed this bug,   
    
    - I added this section/analysis/figure (cf. sensible commit message).
    
    - I finished testing a (batch of) participant(s). 
    
    - When going from pilot to actual, etc.

---


# Understanding diff &amp; status, &amp; log

- Rstudio: git tab `\(\to\)` diff

Command line:
- *git status* (where are you in your project)

- *git log* (overview of all commits)

- *git diff* (changes made to a repo since the most recent commit)

- *git diff 47f748 09633c myfile.py* (changes between two commits for myfile)

# Restoring files aka time travel!

Sometimes we want to restore a previous version of a file entirely. 

--

- *git log --oneline*

--

- *git checkout 47f748 word_count.py* (use commit nb of the state before the change weâ€™re trying to undo)

--

- Commit to finalize the restore:
Rather than eliminating the commits that were made, git creates a new commit that changes everything back, ie you can change your mind again. (git never forgets/failsafe)

# Push it &amp; pull it

.pull-left[
- No automatic sync for collaborating (for code constant syncing in real time would be a disaster)
- Rstudio: git tab `\(\to\)` push (after commiting locally)
- When collaborating, ie changes have may been pushed by someone else: Rstudio: git tab `\(\to\)` pull (before working locally)

Command line: 
- *git remote add origin https://github.com/try-git/try_git.git*
- *git push origin master*
- *git pull origin master*
]

.pull-right[
![image](img/github-repo-after-first-push.png)
]

---

# Conflicts &amp; merging

But what happens if we make a commit in both places?

- Try it: change the README on github repo (*btw: you can edit files directly in Github*). Push will be rejected `\(\to\)`  do a pull &amp; auto-merge first. However: If change in same line/file: 

```
[...]
From https://github.com/vlad/planets
 branch            master     -&gt; FETCH_HEAD
Auto-merging mars.txt
* CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in mars.txt
* Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
[...]
```

```
[...] The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
* &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD
We added a different line in the other copy
* =======
This line added to Wolfman's copy

# Cloning, forking, &amp; branching

- Clone: download local copy of existing repo (cannot push to origin)

- Fork ([example](https://github.com/hoenir/hoenir.github.io)): copy of existing repo under your account. Keeps the link between projects `\(\to\)` *pull requests* on github
    
--

- [Branching](https://barbagroup.github.io/essential_skills_RRC/git/branching/#branching-as-a-local-fork) as a local fork to work on a new feature, a new version, to experiment with variants of your code. Can be merged again with the *master* branch (or removed). Can only be used with command line.

# Branching

---

# What to use it for?

- All code:

  - R or python analysis: [R Markdown files](https://github.com/hoenir/Reproducible_workflow_tutorial/blob/master/git_for_psychologists.md) and [Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/hoenir/MooneyTD_AQ_ASD/blob/master/analysisAdolescentsASD2016.ipynb) will appear in human-readable, pretty format on github.
  - Your experiment code 

--

- You can use it to backup/share your (behavioral) data and stimuli too. But size limits for non-text files (for very large stimuli or data files, use figshare, Zenodo, OSF).

--

- What about manuscripts? Only if in markdown/latex (but no good solution for citations, track changes)

--

- [Private github repos](https://education.github.com/pack) means you choose when to make your repo/project public (holds for github and osf)

---

# More advantages

- Integrity of each commit is checked (safety against file corruption) with checksums (hash values of content=names in git db)

- Backup on another computer (safer &amp; better ordered than dropbox, cf code conflicts)

- Collaboration (one common repo on github): better conflict management

- Commits helps you tell the story of your project to other people (reproducibility)

- Time-stamped (pre)registration of state of steps in your project (if you commit, of course)

---

# Further tools that connect with git(hub)

- Github-[OSF integration](https://osf.io/4e7hr/): 

    - Two-way sync: edit in OSF, in github (or locally).
    - Storage **remains** in github 
    
--
    
- Persistent copy needed? [Zenodo](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/) or [figshare](http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2016-using-zenodo-to-archive-github.html) can archive your github repo (with citable DOI). 

--

- Github watching &amp; forking (take existing project/experiment as basis to start yourself; also on OSF)

- Reputation system (for some jobs in the private sector, gtihub account is de facto cv/portfolio)

- [GestaltReVision repos](https://github.com/gestaltrevision)
